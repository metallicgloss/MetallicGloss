## A Little Bit About Me

I'm a computing student living in the United Kingdom, attending the University of Greenwich to undertake a bachelor's degree in the field. At 16, I turned my love for gaming into a business opportunity and continue to act as a company director at [Encrypted Laser Limited](https://www.encryptedlaser.com "Encrypted Laser Limited"), managing operations at both [PrimeNodes](https://www.primenodes.com "PrimeNodes - Premium Infrastructure Provider") and [ELHS](https://www.elhostingservices.com "ELHostingServices") on a daily basis.

## Projects

Due to the vast majority of my time being allocated to study activities or management duties at PrimeNodes, I'm not currently available to carry out any freelance work. Sorry! I'll still be occasionally performing corrective maintenance to past projects, but for the foreseeable future, my open-source contributions or releases will be limited.

## Code Breakdown

<img align="left" title="Top Languages" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=metallicgloss&layout=compact" />

My repertoire of skills extends across various programming languages and libraries; languages that I have the most experience with, and am most comfortable undertaking projects in, include **PHP** (Laravel & Yii), **C#** (.NET Core & Framework), **Python** (Django & Flask) and **Javascript**. The codebase of [SteamChatManager](https://www.metallicgloss.com/projects/steamchatmanager) and various projects for private clients are not open source, and as such, do not contribute to the statistics provided.
